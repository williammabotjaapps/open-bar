# Project Title

## Overview
This project utilizes **JSON-Server** to create a mock backend for rapid development and testing. It provides a simple way to simulate a RESTful API, allowing you to focus on building your frontend without waiting for a backend to be ready.

I am aware the persistent layer is optional but I wanted to showcase my REST capabilities in a Production type of environment. 

## Usage

### Install Dependencies
To get started, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash

### Run the Server

```bash
